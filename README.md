# Investigating 'No Show Appointments' Dataset
## by Opara Febechukwu Chinonyerem


## Dataset

> This project is investigating the No Show Appointments dataset from Kaggle. It is a dataset of 100,000 (100K) medical appointments in Brazil that is focused on the question of whether or not patients show up for their appointment.

The questions we would answer in this data analysis include:

    The number of Brazillians keeping to their appointment and those not keeping to their appointment, which is greater?
    Patients who received sms and those who didn't which is greater?
    Brazillians on the Brasilian welfare program and those not on it, which is greater?
    How many patients at a particular neighbourhood hospital kept to their appointment and how many failed to keep to their appointment?
    Which Neighbourhood has none of the patients keeping to their appointment?
    What gender of patients kept to their appointment most?
    Population of female patients compared to male patients which is greater?
    Are patients on Brasilian Welfare Programme (Bolsa Familia) keeping to their appointment more than patients who aren't on the welfare programe?
    Does the hipertension, diabetes and alcoholism status of patients affect their keeping to their appointments?
    What is the mean age of Brazillian patients?

Below is a brief description of the fields of the dataset:

**PatientId:** It bears the id of the patient.

**Gender:** It bears the gender of the patient.

**ScheduledDay:** It bears the day the patient called for the appointment.

**AppointmentDay:** It bears the day the patient is to visit the hospital for their appointment.

**Age:** It bears the age of the patient.

**Neighbourhood:** It bears the location of the hospital where the appointment was scheduled.

**Scholarship:** It bears the status of the patient as regarding if the patient is on Brasilian welfare program (Bolsa Familia).

**Hipertension:** It bears the hipertensive status of the patient.

**Diabetes** It bears the diabetic status of the patient.

**Alcoholism** It bears the alcoholic status of the patient.

**Handcap** It bears the handicap status of the patient.

**SMS_received** It shows if the patient received an sms about their appointment or not.

**No-show** It bears 'no' if the patient visited and 'yes' if the patient did not visit.


## Limitation of Study

> The study did not consider the appointment date and scheduled date as factors which could encourage or discourage a patient in keeping to their appointment. Future studies can incorporate that.


## Key Insights for Presentation

> From the statistical analysis, we observed the following:

    1. That despite the fact that many Brazillians are not on the Brasilian Welfare Program, many of them keep to their hospital appointment.

    2. Also, many do not get sms about their appointment and they still keep to their appointment.

    3. Population of Male patients is lower than the population of female patients.

    4. Neighbourhood ILHAS OCEANICAS DE has none of her patients showing up for their appointment.

    5. Female patients are greater than male patients.

    6. Female patients show up for their appointment more than male patients.

    7. Many Brazillians are not on the Bolsa Familia programme but yet a large number of them show up for their medical appointments.

    8. The number of patients hipertensive showing up for the appointment is greater than the number of patients who aren't that are showing up for their appointment.

    9. A large number of patients are not diabetic and patients who aren't diabetic were showing up for appointment more than those who are diabetic.

    10. Alcoholism does not really prevent Brazilians from showing up for their appointments.
    
    11. A large number of Brazilians are not alcoholic.
